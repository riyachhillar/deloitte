The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 was passed by the Parliament of India on 11 December 2019. It amended the Citizenship Act of 1955 
by providing a path to Indian citizenship for Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, and Christian religious minorities fleeing persecution
from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.[2] Muslims were not given such eligibility.[3][4] The act was the first time religion had been
overtly used as a criterion for citizenship under Indian law.[5] But scholars point out that the Indian citizenship law has always been
informed by the idea of "India is for Hindus"
